# Install Python

Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
for your specific operating system (OS) and install accordingly. Do
not change any of the default settings and PATH in the installation.

Test the Python installation with:

```
python --version
# should print something like 3.12.6 or closer.
```

# Install Git

`git` is a version control system (VCS). You can download `git` from
[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your OS. Install `git`
without changing any of the default settings and PATH in settings. Test
the installation with:

```
git -v
# should print something like git version 2.46.0 or closer.
```
